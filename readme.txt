A few notes about the sections above:

==   Payment Gateway Services ==

When you buy something at the store and you go to the counter to pay, a store clerk processes the transaction on a cash register (or maybe even a mobile device like a smartphone or tablet), which functions as a point of sale (POS) terminal. The same sort of thing happens when you buy a movie online using your credit card, except the entire process is completed virtually through a software service called a payment gateway.

It might sound a little confusing, but it’s actually pretty simple! Take a look at the following points below for more information, and don’t hesitate to call us or fill out a contact form if you still have questions about the payment gateway services offered at PayCertify

= What exactly does a payment gateway do? =

Payment gateway services allow a transaction to take place between a customer and merchant. The software transfers credit card information at lightning speeds between the merchant’s computer system and the processing service or bank.

= How does a payment gateway service work? =

You’ve probably seen payment gateways in use dozens of times without even realizing it; every time you make a purchase online and you click that “Submit Payment” button, that’s when the whole process starts. It’s a long chain of digital commands between your computer, the merchant, and the bank that issued your credit card. If the bank approves the card transaction, then the process continues until the money is taken out of the customer’s account and transferred to the merchant.

= Are these gateways safe? =

Not all payment gateways are secure, especially as cybersecurity problems become more complex. The key here is to look for a service ensuring that credit card information will be encrypted before being transferred, as well as services that have anti-fraud detection features.

= Does every online business need to have a payment gateway? =

These days, payment gateway services are pretty much necessary for any business that needs to process transactions virtually.

= What are the best payment gateway services? =

This question isn’t too easy to answer, simply because there isn’t one perfect payment gateway service for every business. The best thing to do is to contact a service provider like PayCertify and talk to the experts about what your business needs in a payment gateway service, what you can afford, and any extra features you’d like to have.

== Credit Card Chargeback Protection ==

Chargebacks can also be frustrating for merchants, though, because some consumers abuse the protective nature of chargeback policies. For this reason, it’s essential that every merchant running an online business has a secure payment service in place that can detect possible security threats before they occur, and that they make the chargeback process as simple as possible when it is justified.

So what do online merchants need to know about chargebacks, and how can a secure payment processing service help? First off, there are ways to prevent legitimate chargebacks from occurring (because they will likely occur at the loss of your business). With an advanced payment service, such as what you will find at PayCertify, payment services include features which detect fraudulent credit cards.

Without these features, you could be held liable for many credit card chargebacks. If you’re conducting transactions globally (or if you hope to do so in the future), you’ll want a payment processing software that can detect these issues in order to process transactions correctly the first time around. This is one of the more confusing parts of online sales and it is not easy to do without the help of a secure payment service. If transactions aren’t processed with the correct price, the merchant may be held liable for any chargebacks.

Last but not least, the best way that merchants can ensure they’re providing customers with the best service possible (without putting their own business in financial jeopardy) is to have detailed records on hand for each purchase, exchange, and return. Credit card chargebacks can be pretty complicated, but accurate detailed records will help you and the credit card company determine if a charge was fraudulent or legitimate.

== Secure Payment System ==

Many businesses today use third-party payment services to ensure that when an online transaction is made, every piece of sensitive data is guarded safely. The most popular payment medium you’ve heard about — and maybe even used before — is PayPal, which allows any business or individual to make transactions virtually, without the assistance of a traditional point of sale (POS) terminal.

But let’s face it: PayPal isn’t going to cut it for businesses that want to be 100% in charge of their own sales, and it’s not always easy to separate the secure payment systems from the questionable ones.

Here are a few things you should know about secure payment systems, the details you should pay attention to when looking for one, and why it’s best to go through a third-party service like PayCertify.

As more consumers have begun turning to online marketplaces to purchase products and services, secure payment options have become necessities for businesses. Since a secure payment gateway will allow a customer to make a transaction with your business regardless of where he/she is located, secure payment processing is essential if you want to help your business grow.

There are a couple of things that every payment system should have: encryption software and fraud detection software. Keep in mind, though, that these two features are just the basics when it comes to high-quality secure payment services. Every business is unique, so every payment system needs to be flexible enough to fit the needs of each business — it’s as simple as that.

And because cyber security is more complicated than ever, it’s imperative that you can turn to a payment service provider for help if you need it. There’s no shame in admitting that you don’t know the first thing about cyber security or payment processing (unless that’s what your business is supposed to provide). Your customers are entrusting you with some of their most personal and valuable pieces of information, and you owe it to them to work with only the best payment service providers.

Quite simply, businesses turn to third-party mediators for secure payment services because these businesses are busy providing the products and services that their customers actually paid for. With the services provided by PayCertify, you’ll be able to focus on your business without worrying about the security of your customers’ information.
